The fact that younger age groups are smaller compared to the 20-40 years groups suggests that fewer children are being born. This pattern is common in countries experiencing demographic transitions where birth rates drop as societies become more developed, urbanized, and educated. With fewer children being born, the population is aging, and a larger proportion of people are in the working-age (20-59 years) or older age categories.

The relatively wide middle section (ages 20-40 years) indicates a strong working-age population, which can support the economy. However, as this cohort ages, the proportion of elderly individuals will increase, placing pressure on healthcare and pension systems in the long term. If this trend continues, the overall population may begin to decline because the smaller younger generation will lead to fewer births in the future.

In the oldest age groups (ages 80+ years), women outnumber men, this suggest that women have a longer life expectancy than men.
